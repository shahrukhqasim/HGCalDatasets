## cropped-alpha
This dataset is based on simulations run by Jan Kieseler. The simualations are based on 8 particles per event. However in this dataset, the separated examples are cropped close to every particle from the event. Simclusters are matched to this particle according to its decay tree. Hence we get all the rechits belonging to shower associated to all of the 8 particles and can compute the fraction.

### Fraction
How much of energy deposit belongs to the shower of the particle.

### Particles
1. Electron
2. Muon
3. Charged Pion
4. Gamma

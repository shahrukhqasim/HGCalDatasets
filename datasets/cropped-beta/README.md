## cropped-beta
This dataset is based on simulations run by Jan Kieseler. The simualations are based on 8 particles per event. However in this dataset, the separated examples are cropped close to every particle from the event.


### Particles
1. Electron
2. Muon
3. Charged Pion
4. Gamma

### Pileup
The PU is 200 in this dataset.


### Experiments

1. Particle Classification
2. Energy regression
3. Simulation (GANs)
